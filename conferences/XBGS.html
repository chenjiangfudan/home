Title: 	Varieties of general type with doubly exponential asymptotics <br />
Abstract: We construct smooth projective varieties of general type with the smallest known volume and others with the most known vanishing plurigenera in high dimensions. The optimal volume bound is expected to decay doubly exponentially with dimension, and our examples achieve this decay rate. We also consider the analogous questions for other types of varieties. For example, in every dimension we conjecture the terminal Fano variety of minimal volume, and the canonical Calabi-Yau variety of minimal volume. In each case, our examples exhibit doubly exponential behavior. (Joint work with Louis Esser and Chengxi Wang.) </p>

Title: 	Bigness of tangent bundles of Fano manifolds with zero dimensional VMRT <br />
Abstract: It is expected that the bigness of tangent bundle is a quite restrictive property for Fano manifolds, especially for those of Picard number one. In this talk, I will present our recent first attempt to tackle this problem. More precise, we will consider Fano manifolds of Picard number one and having zero-dimensional VMRT, and it turns out that in this case only the quintic del Pezzo threefold has big tangent bundle. This is based on my recent joint work with Andreas HÃ¶ring.

Title: Noether-Severi inequality and equality for irregular threefolds of general type<br />
Abstract: We prove the optimal Noether-Severi inequality that $\vol(X) \ge \frac{4}{3} \chi(\omega_{X})$ for all smooth and irregular $3$-folds $X$ of general type over $\CC$. This answers an open question of Z. Jiang in dimension three. For those $3$-folds $X$ attaining the equality, we completely describe their canonical models and show that the topological fundamental group $\pi_1(X) \simeq \ZZ^2$. As a corollary, we obtain for the same $X$ another optimal inequality that $\vol(X) \ge \frac{4}{3}h^0_a(X, K_X)$ where $h^0_a(X, K_X)$ stands for the continuous rank of $K_X$, and we show that $X$ attains this equality if and only if $\vol(X) = \frac{4}{3}\chi(\omega_{X})$. This is a joint work with Tong Zhang.</p>

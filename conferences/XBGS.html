Title: 	On extremal varieties of general type <br />
Abstract: Among varieties of general of fixed dimension, there are some known (or expected) constraints on their birational invariant. It is particular interesting to study those varieties whose invariant achieve optimal values. For example, let d_X be the dimension of image of canonical map. If d_X=n, then one has that the canonical volume is greater than or equal to 2(p_g-n). If equality holds, then we call X to be a Horikawa variety.  In this talk, we are going to describe various geometric properties of Horikawa varieties. If time permits, we will also address some relation with threefold of general type on the Noether line and irregular threefold on the Noether-Severi line.

Title: Deformation rigidity of wonderful group compactifications <br />
Abstract: For  a complex connected semisimple linear algebraic group G of adjoint type, De Concini and Procesi constructed its wonderful compactification, which is a smooth Fano equivariant embedding of G enjoying many interesting properties. In this talk, we will discuss on the properties of wonderful group compactifications, especially the deformation rigidity of them. This is a joint work with Baohua Fu. </p>

Title: 	Varieties of general type with doubly exponential asymptotics <br />
Abstract: We construct smooth projective varieties of general type with the smallest known volume and others with the most known vanishing plurigenera in high dimensions. The optimal volume bound is expected to decay doubly exponentially with dimension, and our examples achieve this decay rate. We also consider the analogous questions for other types of varieties. For example, in every dimension we conjecture the terminal Fano variety of minimal volume, and the canonical Calabi-Yau variety of minimal volume. In each case, our examples exhibit doubly exponential behavior. (Joint work with Louis Esser and Chengxi Wang.) </p>

Title: Geometric inequalities inspired by algebraic geometry <br />
Abstract: Geometric inequalities reveal relation between different geometric invariants, such as volume,  surface area, width, diameter, etc.  By the correspondences between convexity and positivity, such as mixed volumes of convex bodies and intersection numbers of divisors, we present a series of new geometric inequalities inspired by positivity results in algebraic and analytic geometry.</p>

Title: 	Bigness of tangent bundles of Fano manifolds with zero dimensional VMRT <br />
Abstract: It is expected that the bigness of tangent bundle is a quite restrictive property for Fano manifolds, especially for those of Picard number one. In this talk, I will present our recent first attempt to tackle this problem. More precise, we will consider Fano manifolds of Picard number one and having zero-dimensional VMRT, and it turns out that in this case only the quintic del Pezzo threefold has big tangent bundle. This is based on my recent joint work with Andreas HÃ¶ring.

Title: Noether-Severi inequality and equality for irregular threefolds of general type<br />
Abstract: We prove the optimal Noether-Severi inequality that $\vol(X) \ge \frac{4}{3} \chi(\omega_{X})$ for all smooth and irregular $3$-folds $X$ of general type over $\CC$. This answers an open question of Z. Jiang in dimension three. For those $3$-folds $X$ attaining the equality, we completely describe their canonical models and show that the topological fundamental group $\pi_1(X) \simeq \ZZ^2$. As a corollary, we obtain for the same $X$ another optimal inequality that $\vol(X) \ge \frac{4}{3}h^0_a(X, K_X)$ where $h^0_a(X, K_X)$ stands for the continuous rank of $K_X$, and we show that $X$ attains this equality if and only if $\vol(X) = \frac{4}{3}\chi(\omega_{X})$. This is a joint work with Tong Zhang.</p>

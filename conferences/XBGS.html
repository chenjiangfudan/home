Title: Gopakumar-Vafa type invariants of holomorphic symplectic 4-folds <br />
Abstract: Gromov-Witten invariants of holomorphic symplectic 4-folds vanish and one can consider the corresponding reduced theory. In this talk, we will explain a definition of Gopakumar-Vafa type invariants for such a reduced theory. These invariants are conjectured to be integers and have alternative interpretations using sheaf theoretic moduli spaces. Our conjecture is proved for the product of two K3 surfaces, which naturally leads to a closed formula of Fujiki constants of Chern classes of tangent bundles of Hilbert schemes of points on K3 surfaces. On a very general holomorphic symplectic 4-folds of K3^[2] type, our conjecture provides a Yau-Zaslow type formula for the number of isolated genus 2 curves of minimal degree. Based on joint works with Georg Oberdieck and Yukinobu Toda.</p>

Title: The Nonvanishing problem for varieties with nef first Chern class  <br />
Abstract: Let X be a threefold with mild singularities such that c1(X) is nef. In this talk I will present a very recent proof that then the numerical class of c1(X) is effective. This result (joint work with Thomas Peternell, Nikolaos Tsakanikas and Zhixin Xie) is the positive curvature counterpart of the famous result of Miyaoka from the 1980s, which showed that –c1(X) is effective as soon as it is nef.</p>

Title:  Motivic invariants of birational maps and Cremona groups <br />
Abstract: (Joint with E. Shinder and partly with S. Zimmerman) In characteristic zero, birational maps of projective varieties factorize through a sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs along smooth centers. We study to which extent these factorization centers are unique, and construct motivic invariants of birational maps which account for the non-uniqueness of centers. For surfaces over a perfect field, we prove the uniqueness of centers in the strongest possible sense. In higher dimension, the centers fail to be unique. Relying on the non-uniqueness, we provide new explanations of the non-simplicity of Cremona groups. </p>

Title: On the anti-canonical geometry of weak Q-Fano 3-folds, III <br />
Abstract: By a terminal weak Q-Fano 3-fold (resp. terminal Q-Fano 3-fold) we mean a normal projective one with at worst terminal singularities on which the anti-canonical divisor is nef and big (resp. ample). For a terminal weak Q-Fano 3-fold X, we show that the m-th anti-canonical map defined by |-mK_X| is birational for all m≥59. Furthermore, if X is a terminal Q-Fano 3-fold, then the m-th anti-canonical map defined by |-mK_X| is birational for all m≥58. (This is a joint work with Chen Jiang)</p>

  Speaker: <strong>Fanjun Meng </strong> (Northwestern University)<br />
Title:  Kodaira dimension of fibrations over abelian varieties  <br />
Abstract: The Kodaira dimension of smooth projective varieties is an important birational invariant. In this talk, we will discuss some conjectures on the behavior of Kodaira dimension proposed by Popa. We prove an additivity result for the log Kodaira dimension of algebraic fiber spaces over abelian varieties, a superadditivity result for algebraic fiber spaces over varieties of maximal Albanese dimension, as well as a subadditivity result for log pairs over abelian varieties. This is joint work with Mihnea Popa.

Title:  On the fixed part of pluricanonical systems for surfaces  <br />
Abstract: Assuming K_X is nef and big or ample, we study the behavior of |mK_X| when the Cartier index of K_X is not bounded.  Especially we are interested in when |mK_X| is free in codim 1 (does not have fixed part).   we show that in general there is no uniform m to ensure |mK_X| free in codim 1 (for klt variety) unless we have some extra assumption on the singularities.    More precisely, we show that |mK_X| defines a birational map and has no fixed part for some bounded positive integer m for any 1/2-lc surface X such that K_X is big and nef. For every positive integer n>2, we construct a sequence of projective surfaces X_{n,i}, such that K_{X_{n,i}} is ample, mld(X_{n,i})>1/n for every i, the limit of mld(X_{n,i}) is 1/n, and for any positive integer m, there exists i such that |mK_{X_{n,i}}| has non-zero fixed part. This is a joint work with Jihao Liu.

Title:  On the boundedness of elliptically fibered varieties<br />
Abstract: In this talk, I will survey recent progress on the question of boundedness for elliptic varieties, in particular for the case of projective Calabi—Yau varieties.I will explain different aspects of the question and discuss some of the techniques involved in proving this type of results, with particular focus to the ideas coming from the MMP and their interaction with other results/conjectures on Calabi—Yau varieties, e.g.,  the Kawamata-Morrison Cone Conjecture. The talk will discuss results from joint collaborations with Di Cerbo, Di Cerbo and Birkar, and particularly the recent work in collaboration with Filipazzi and Hacon.

Title:  Characterization of projective toric varieties from dynamical viewpoints <br />
Abstract: As a fundamental building block of the equivariant minimal model program, the rationally connected variety plays a significant role in the classification of projective varieties admitting non-isomorphic endomorphisms. Twenty years ago, Nakayama confirmed Sato’s conjecture that, a smooth projective rational surface is toric if and only if it admits a non-isomorphic endomorphism. In this talk, I will survey some recent progress on a higher dimensional analogue of Nakayama’s result. This talk is based on some joint works with Jia Jia, Sheng Meng and De-Qi Zhang.

Title: On K-stability of Fano weighted hypersurfaces <br />
Abstract: Weighted complete intersections are a rich source of examples of varieties. K-stability (or existence of Kähler-Einstein metrics) of explicit Fano varieties has been studied for a long time. In this talk, I will explain our results on the K-stability of some Fano weighted hypersurfaces. This is based on joint work with Luca Tasin.

Title:  Normalized tangent bundle, pseudoeffective cone and varieties with small codegree<br />
Abstract: We propose a conjectural list of Fano manifolds of Picard num- ber one whose normalized tangent bundle is pseudoeffective and we prove it in various situations by relating it to the complete divisibility conjecture of Russo and Zak on varieties with small codegrees. The pseudoeffective cone of the projectivized tangent bundle of a rational homogeneous space of Picard number one is explicitly determined by studying the total dual VMRT and the geometry of stratified Mukai flops.

Title: 	A snapshot of Serrano's conjecture <br />
Abstract: Strictly nef divisors sit between nef divisors and ample divisors. A natural question is how far are strictly nef divisors from being ample. In this area, Serrano's conjecture predicts that after twisting by the canonical divisor a little bit, the adjoint strictly nef divisor should be ample. In this talk, I will survey some recent progress on this conjecture. (Part of my works is jointed with Roberto Svaldi, part is jointed with Shin-ichi Matsumura.) </p>

Title: 	On extremal varieties of general type <br />
Abstract: Among varieties of general of fixed dimension, there are some known (or expected) constraints on their birational invariant. It is particular interesting to study those varieties whose invariant achieve optimal values. For example, let d_X be the dimension of image of canonical map. If d_X=n, then one has that the canonical volume is greater than or equal to 2(p_g-n). If equality holds, then we call X to be a Horikawa variety.  In this talk, we are going to describe various geometric properties of Horikawa varieties. If time permits, we will also address some relation with threefold of general type on the Noether line and irregular threefold on the Noether-Severi line.

Title: Deformation rigidity of wonderful group compactifications <br />
Abstract: For  a complex connected semisimple linear algebraic group G of adjoint type, De Concini and Procesi constructed its wonderful compactification, which is a smooth Fano equivariant embedding of G enjoying many interesting properties. In this talk, we will discuss on the properties of wonderful group compactifications, especially the deformation rigidity of them. This is a joint work with Baohua Fu. </p>

Title: 	Varieties of general type with doubly exponential asymptotics <br />
Abstract: We construct smooth projective varieties of general type with the smallest known volume and others with the most known vanishing plurigenera in high dimensions. The optimal volume bound is expected to decay doubly exponentially with dimension, and our examples achieve this decay rate. We also consider the analogous questions for other types of varieties. For example, in every dimension we conjecture the terminal Fano variety of minimal volume, and the canonical Calabi-Yau variety of minimal volume. In each case, our examples exhibit doubly exponential behavior. (Joint work with Louis Esser and Chengxi Wang.) </p>

Title: Geometric inequalities inspired by algebraic geometry <br />
Abstract: Geometric inequalities reveal relation between different geometric invariants, such as volume,  surface area, width, diameter, etc.  By the correspondences between convexity and positivity, such as mixed volumes of convex bodies and intersection numbers of divisors, we present a series of new geometric inequalities inspired by positivity results in algebraic and analytic geometry.</p>

Title: 	Bigness of tangent bundles of Fano manifolds with zero dimensional VMRT <br />
Abstract: It is expected that the bigness of tangent bundle is a quite restrictive property for Fano manifolds, especially for those of Picard number one. In this talk, I will present our recent first attempt to tackle this problem. More precise, we will consider Fano manifolds of Picard number one and having zero-dimensional VMRT, and it turns out that in this case only the quintic del Pezzo threefold has big tangent bundle. This is based on my recent joint work with Andreas Höring.

Title: Noether-Severi inequality and equality for irregular threefolds of general type<br />
Abstract: We prove the optimal Noether-Severi inequality that $\vol(X) \ge \frac{4}{3} \chi(\omega_{X})$ for all smooth and irregular $3$-folds $X$ of general type over $\CC$. This answers an open question of Z. Jiang in dimension three. For those $3$-folds $X$ attaining the equality, we completely describe their canonical models and show that the topological fundamental group $\pi_1(X) \simeq \ZZ^2$. As a corollary, we obtain for the same $X$ another optimal inequality that $\vol(X) \ge \frac{4}{3}h^0_a(X, K_X)$ where $h^0_a(X, K_X)$ stands for the continuous rank of $K_X$, and we show that $X$ attains this equality if and only if $\vol(X) = \frac{4}{3}\chi(\omega_{X})$. This is a joint work with Tong Zhang.</p>
